# Sneaker Inventory Tracking Application

## What is it?
I have created a sneaker tracking website that creates new profiles for a user.

## How to use it
Once the user inputs all the required information into the form, then just click submit. If you want to reset the form just hit the reset buttom. It will create a new inventory item that the user can now use to track their inventory for the business.

## How will this help?
This will be a great tool for anyone working in the sneaker industry as sellers we have to constantly be updating our inventory items to keep track of what's coming in and out.

## How to delete an item
If a user no longer has an Item in their inventory they can remove it by simply clicking the "Remove Item" button under the new sneaker.
